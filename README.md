# Zaku-IDF

![Zaku Robot](zaku_image.jpg)

## Introduction

Zaku-IDF is a firmware application developed for controlling and monitoring a robotic system using the ESP32 microcontroller and Espressif IoT Development Framework (ESP-IDF). The firmware enables seamless integration with various sensors and actuators, facilitating real-time data acquisition, processing, and control operations.

## Features

- **Sensor Integration**: Interfacing with environmental sensors (e.g., DHT11), ultrasonic distance sensors, and infrared sensors for collecting crucial data about the robot's surroundings.
- **MQTT Communication**: Establishing communication with MQTT broker for publishing sensor data and subscribing to control commands, enabling seamless integration with IoT systems.
- **Motor Control**: Implementing PID controller for precise motor speed control based on sensor feedback, enhancing the robot's maneuverability and responsiveness.
- **Data Logging**: Logging sensor data to CSV files for further analysis, documentation, and visualization, facilitating comprehensive understanding and optimization of robot performance.

## Usage

1. **Hardware Setup**: Connect the required sensors and actuators to the ESP32 microcontroller according to the pin configurations specified in the code.
2. **Software Configuration**: Customize MQTT broker settings, Wi-Fi credentials, and sensor parameters as needed for your application.
3. **Build and Flash**: Compile the firmware using ESP-IDF toolchain and flash it to the ESP32 device.
4. **Monitor Operation**: Monitor the operation of the robot through MQTT messages or by accessing the generated CSV files containing sensor data.
